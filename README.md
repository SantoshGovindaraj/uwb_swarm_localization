Monitoring Multi Robots framework by using Ultra-Wide Band Technology with ROS

Master Thesis Project with DARTeC Cranfield University under MSc Robotics 2021-22
The aim of the project is to develop a centralized framework for multi-robot deployed workspace. The framework's responsibility is to employ internal collision avoidance, common navigation map, dynamic global collision avoidance and task allocation for robots. The framework should also have the capability to provide the visual digital twin of the workspace with the real-time robots motion. 

This framework incorporates Ultra-Wide Band technology for high precision robot maneuvers and will be built based on the open-source architecture design of ROS.

## Aim of the Repository
- Provide a basic task allocation for the each robots in the framework
- Provide a localization using Ultra Wide Band Technology available in the University
- Provide the behaviour options 
- Diplay functionallity
